# Traffic-sign-classification

In this project, we will be use a Convolutional Neutal Network to build train, and test a traffic sign classification model. We will buld this model usnig TensorFlow and Keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. this model can be used to make smarter cars.
After this project, you will be able to create a Multiclass classification model using Deep Learning. 


This model can be used in self driving cars which will enable them to automatically recognize traffic signs similarly the driver alert system inside cars will help and protect drivers by understanding the traffic signs around them.
