# Traffic-sign-classification

In this project, we will be use a Convolutional Neutal Network to build train, and test a traffic sign classification model. We will buld this model usnig TensorFlow and Keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. this model can be used to make smarter cars.
After this project, you will be able to create a Multiclass classification model using Deep Learning.
